drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## Load the Model and CSV

Download model above (Inception V3) and CSV for the nutrition

```python
be.clear_session()
model_path = "./model_inceptionV3.h5"
print("loading the model..")
model = load_model(model_path)
```
    
## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following code:

```python
predict_image(<file_path>, model)
```
